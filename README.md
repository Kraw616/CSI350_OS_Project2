## Execution Instructions
1. Download the source code
2. Navigate to the directory where the files are locating using `cd ...` prompts.
3. Compile the .cpp files in your favorite C++ compiler, for example, in Terminal/a command prompt:                                                     `g++ main.cpp fifo_and_srt.cpp scheduling_fifo.cpp scheduling_srt.cpp setup.cpp` (order does not matter) in the directory containing all the source files. Make sure that all 7 files are present (including the 2 headers!!), but **do not compile the .h files!** You will get a bunch of warnings, which is normal; pay no mind to them (as long as they aren't errors)!
4. In the same terminal/command window, type `./a.out` or just run the executable/object file.
5. If you have trouble compiling/running the program (like I did on Mac), I would recommend using an online C++ compiler such as [this](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler). Just make sure to create 7 files on there and copy and paste from the originals.
6. Rejoice!
